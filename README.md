## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you don't need a complex build setup for the basic version.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the source code.
2.  **Open `index.html`** directly in your modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    *   *Note: For the best experience with video playback, use a live server (like VS Code's Live Server extension) instead of just opening the file directly.*

## 🎨 Customization

-   **Styles**: The main styles are in `style.css`. If you have the SCSS source (`style.scss`), you can modify that and recompile for easier changes.
-   **Animations**: Tweak animation timing and easing in `script.js` and `footer.js`.
-   **Content**: Update images and text directly in `index.html`.
